# 🌐 Browser Access Solution for Forex Sentiment Dashboard

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The 403 Forbidden error you encountered is due to Google Cloud Run's authentication requirements. Your organization's security policies prevent public access, which is actually a **good security practice** for enterprise environments.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

I've created a **browser-compatible authentication solution** that allows you to access your beautiful frontend dashboard through your web browser.

## 🚀 How to Access Your Dashboard

### Method 1: Use the Browser Access Tool (Recommended)

1. **Open the browser access tool:**
   ```bash
   open simple_browser_access.html
   ```
   Or double-click the `simple_browser_access.html` file

2. **Get your authentication token:**
   - Click "📋 Copy Command" to copy the gcloud command
   - Run it in your terminal:
     ```bash
     gcloud auth print-identity-token
     ```

3. **Paste your token** in the text area

4. **Test connection** to verify it works

5. **Click "🚀 Open Dashboard"** to access your frontend

### Method 2: Use the Command Line Script

```bash
./open_dashboard.sh
```

This script will:
- Get your token automatically
- Test the connection
- Provide you with the authenticated URL

### Method 3: Manual Browser Access

1. Get your token:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth print-identity-token
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   https://forex-sentiment-analyzer-158616853756.us-central1.run.app
   ```

3. You'll get a 403 error initially, but the browser access tool handles this properly
