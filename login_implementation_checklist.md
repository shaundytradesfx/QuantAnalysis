 Design & Planning (Day 1)

1.1 Define Requirements & User Flow
Document Allowed Admin Users: List the two admin usernames and decide on their unique passwords (to be hashed and stored securely). 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Decide Storage Mechanism: Choose whether to store credentials in an encrypted database table or use environment variables (with hashed passwords) per OWASP secret management guidelines.
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series

Outline Authentication Flow:
User accesses /login page → enters username & password → backend verifies credentials → on success, create a session (cookie or JWT) → redirect to admin dashboard → on failure, display error. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
IEEE Cybersecurity
Specify Session Management: Decide to use server‑side sessions with strong session IDs (stored in HTTP‑only cookies) or stateless JWT tokens with short expiration. 
IEEE Cybersecurity
Datadog
Define Access Control Rules:
Only authenticated sessions grant access to all admin routes (e.g., /admin/*); any attempt without session → redirect to /login. 
Stack Overflow
1.2 Security & Secret Handling
Password Hashing Algorithm: Select a strong, adaptive hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2) with an appropriate cost factor to store hashed passwords. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
StrongDM
Secret Storage:
If using environment variables, store only the hashed passwords; never store plaintext.
Use a secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Vault) to store any database credentials or webhook URLs, as recommended by OWASP. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Datadog
Implement Least Privilege: The admin accounts should have no additional privileges beyond accessing the login page and admin screens. The application’s service account for database access should only have read access to the hashed password table. 
Microsoft Learn
Securden
Lockdown Admin Routes: Ensure the admin section is not publicly discoverable (e.g., restrict via firewall or private subnet, if possible). 
Stack Overflow
1.3 Technology Stack & Dependencies
Choose Framework/Stack: Confirm the tech stack (e.g., Node.js + Express, Python + Flask/Django, or similar).
Identify Libraries:
For Node.js: use bcrypt for hashing, express-session or jsonwebtoken for sessions.
For Python: use werkzeug.security (Flask) or Django’s built‑in auth system.
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Dependency Versions: Pin versions of all authentication‑related packages to known stable releases to avoid security regressions.
Setup Development Environment: Create a feature branch, pull a fresh clone, and install dependencies.
2. Backend Implementation (Day 1–2)

2.1 Database Schema & Secret Setup
Create admins Table:
CREATE TABLE admins (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Insert Two Admin Records:
Generate bcrypt hashes for the two chosen passwords using a script or REPL.
Insert rows: INSERT INTO admins (username, password_hash) VALUES ('admin1', '<hash1>'), ('admin2', '<hash2>');
Ensure no plaintext is committed to version control.
Configure Environment Variables:
Add DB_CONNECTION_STRING, SESSION_SECRET, ADMIN_JWT_SECRET, and any other keys to a .env or a secrets vault.
Verify access via the application’s configuration module. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Secrets Management:
If using a vault (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager), write code to fetch secrets at runtime rather than storing directly in .env. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series

2.2 Authentication Logic
Implement Login Endpoint (POST /login):
Extract Credentials: Read username and password from the request body; enforce type="password" and length limits per OWASP. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Fetch Stored Hash: Query SELECT password_hash FROM admins WHERE username = ?; if no row, return “Invalid credentials”. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Verify Password: Compare plaintext password with stored hash using bcrypt.compare() (Node.js) or check_password_hash() (Flask).
Error Handling: On any exception (e.g., DB failure), log at ERROR and return a generic “Login failed” without revealing details. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Session Creation:
If credentials valid, create a session entry:
Server‑Side Session: Generate a session ID, store in memory/Redis with user_id and expires_at, set cookie with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Strict. 
IEEE Cybersecurity
Datadog
JWT Alternative: Create a signed JWT with short expiry (e.g., 15 minutes) containing username and role=admin, returned to client in a secure cookie. 
Curity
Protected Route Middleware:
Write middleware to check for a valid session (or valid JWT) on each request to /admin/*. If invalid or missing, redirect to /login. 
IEEE Cybersecurity
Datadog
Logout Endpoint (POST /logout):
Destroy the session (delete from store or blacklist JWT).
Clear the cookie on the client side. 
IEEE Cybersecurity
2.3 Security Enhancements
Brute‑Force Protection:
Implement rate limiting (e.g., max 5 login attempts per minute per IP) to block repeated failures.
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
StrongDM
Account Lockout (Optional):
Because only two admins, optionally lock account after 5 consecutive failures; notify a secondary admin via email or logging. 
StrongDM
CSRF Protection:
For forms, include CSRF tokens (e.g., using csurf in Express or Django’s built‑in middleware).
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
HTTP Security Headers:
Add Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options: DENY, X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff, and Strict-Transport-Security. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Datadog
3. Frontend Implementation (Day 2)

3.1 Login Page Design & Form
Create /login Route & View:
Simple HTML form with fields: username (type="text"), password (type="password"), and a “Sign In” button. Ensure autocomplete="off" for security. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Responsive Layout:
Use a minimal CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap or Tailwind) to center the form on screen; keep UI uncluttered since it’s internal.
Client‑Side Validation:
Validate that both fields are nonempty before submission; enforce max length (e.g., 64 characters) to match backend. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Error Display:
Show generic error (“Invalid credentials”) without revealing which field is incorrect.
Clear password field on error.
3.2 Session Handling on Client
Cookie Configuration:
Ensure the cookie from login has Secure, HttpOnly, and SameSite=Strict.
Redirects:
On successful login (HTTP 200), redirect to /admin/dashboard.
On logout, redirect to /login.
4. Security & Testing (Day 2–3)

4.1 Unit & Integration Tests
Password Hashing Test:
Verify that hashing the same password never produces the same hash (bcrypt salt behavior).
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Credential Verification Test:
Write tests to simulate valid and invalid login attempts (correct username/password, correct username/incorrect password, nonexistent username). 
IEEE Cybersecurity
Session Middleware Test:
For /admin/* endpoints, assert that requests without a valid session/JWT get redirected to /login.
Assert that with a valid session/JWT, the endpoints respond with HTTP 200. 
IEEE Cybersecurity
Rate Limiting Test:
Simulate multiple failed login attempts from the same IP to confirm the rate limiter blocks further requests. 
StrongDM
CSRF Test:
Ensure that login form submission without a valid CSRF token is rejected with HTTP 403.
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
4.2 Security Audits
OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet Review:
Validate password length limits, enforcement of HttpOnly cookies, and proper error messages per OWASP. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Datadog
OWASP Secrets Management:
Confirm no secrets (e.g., plaintext passwords) are stored in source control; verify use of environment variables or vault. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
arXiv
Penetration Test (Basic):
Attempt SQL injection on login endpoint to ensure prepared statements or ORM are used.
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Try cross‑site scripting (XSS) by injecting scripts into the username field to confirm proper escaping.
Dependency Vulnerability Scan:
Run npm audit (Node.js) or pip-audit (Python) to find known vulnerabilities in authentication‑related packages. 
Datadog
5. Deployment & Monitoring (Day 3)

5.1 Deployment Preparation
Environment Configuration:
Set NODE_ENV=production (Node.js) or FLASK_ENV=production/DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=prod_settings. Ensure debug modes are disabled. 
Datadog
Verify SESSION_SECRET and ADMIN_JWT_SECRET are defined in production environment variables or fetched from Vault. 
OWASP Cheat Sheet Series
Securden
Database Migration:
Run migration scripts to create the admins table and seed the two admin records (hashed).
Build & Bundle Frontend:
If using a bundler (e.g., Webpack), run npm run build or equivalent; verify static assets are minified.
5.2 Launch & Smoke Tests
Smoke Test Login Flow:
In production staging, attempt to access /admin/dashboard without login → expect redirect to /login.
Login with valid admin1 credentials → expect redirect to dashboard.
Login with invalid credentials → expect “Invalid credentials” and no session cookie.
IEEE Cybersecurity
Logout Test:
After login, call /logout → expect session invalidated and redirect to /login.
Rate Limiting in Prod:
Trigger multiple failed logins to confirm the limit is enforced in production. 
StrongDM
5.3 Monitoring & Alerts
Error Logging:
Configure logs to capture authentication errors (with level = WARN for failures, ERROR for exceptions) but never log plaintext passwords. 
Datadog
Alerting on Suspicious Activity:
Set up alerts if more than 10 failed login attempts occur within an hour, indicating a possible brute‑force attack. 
StrongDM
Health Check Endpoint:
Create a /health endpoint that verifies DB connectivity and returns HTTP 200; integrate with uptime monitoring. 
Datadog
Secrets Rotation Plan:
Document a plan to rotate admin passwords every quarter and update the hashed values in the database or environment variables.
