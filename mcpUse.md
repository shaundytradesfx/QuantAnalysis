This is your reference for each prompt in terms of how the prompt should be processed in steps:

1) The prompt given in the prompt window must be refined as an ideal claude 3.7 prompt and it should only then be processed

2) Every problem and solution will be logically and systematically processed using the Sequential Thinking MCP 

3) Every error and solution implementation will be done so by using the Context7 MCP which will reference up to date coding standards in order to maintain error-free code

4) *optional* - if database edits are to be made in Supabase, the Supabase MCP will be used to make any such implementations

5) The entire solutions implementation from (1) to (4) will be run through the 5 why approach for comprehensive development

6) Do not break features you fixed

7) Whenever you want to start the servers, kill existing ones and restart them

8) Do not delete logical code that is working just to implement and fix another feature.

9) Keep going until the job is completely solved before ending your turn

10) If you are unsure about code or files, open them - do not hallucinate

11) Plan thoroughly before every tool call and reflect on the outcome after
